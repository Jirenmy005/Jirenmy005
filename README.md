-  Hi, I’m @Jirenmy005, I'm 18 and I'm a brazillian!
-  I love languages and their history, accents, world's history as well as Earth and life's formation's one (I hope this makes sense lol), game developing, biology and dinosaurs!
-  I’m currently learning French, the british RP accent (cause it's cute) and game developing/programming.
-  I'm here to learn more about coding and to pratice whatever I get to know!
